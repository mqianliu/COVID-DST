                "doctor_transcript": "hello and welcome to \u2018ask a doctor\u2019 service . i have reviewed your query and here is my advice . pneumonia can cause pleurisy inflammation of pleura and this can cause similar kind of pain . so in my opinion , you should first get the chest x ray done . if the chest x ray is worsening , then your pain is due to pneumonia and you will need higher antibiotics . but if the chest x ray is improving , then possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely . so apply warm water pad on the affected areas . avoid movements causing pain . avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest . take simple painkillers and muscle relaxant drugs like ibuprofen and thiocolchicoside . don't worry , you will be alright with all these . hope i have solved your query . i will be happy to help you further . wish you good health . thanks .",

                "doctor_transcript": "thanks for your question on healthcare magic . i can understand your concern . pneumonia is less likely to cause nose bleeding . recurrent nose bleeding with coughing are commonly seen with sinusitis . so better to consult ent doctor and get done clinical examination and ct scan of paranasal sinuses pns . also get done chest x ray for pneumonia . if chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia . you may also need endoscopic evaluation of sinuses if ct pns is suggestive of infection or erosion . don't worry , you will be alright with all these . hope i have solved your query . i will be happy to help you further . wish you good health . thanks .",

                "doctor_transcript": "thanks for your question on healthcare magic . i can understand your concern . since you are taking warfarin blood thinner , possibility of pulmonary embolism pe related pain is less likely . possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely . so avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise . avoid movements causing pain . apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest and back . take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs like ibuprofen and thiocolchicoside . you will mostly improve with all these in 23 days . if not improving then consult doctor . hope i have solved your query . i will be happy to help you further . wish you good health . thanks .",

                "doctor_transcript": "thanks for your question on healthcare magic . i can understand your concern . possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more likely . bronchitis inflammation of airways is common after pneumonia . and persistent dry cough and chest pain are mostly due to bronchitis . so better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and pft pulmonary function test . pft will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only . you will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators formoterol or salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroid ics budesonide or fluticasone . don't worry , you will be alright with all these . hope i have solved your query . i will be happy to help you further . wish you good health . thanks .",

                "doctor_transcript": "thanks for your concern . the dry cough basically has a few causes . . . . first is post nasal drip , second gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn , third cough variant aasthma , forth heart failure and finally interstitial lung disease . based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth , you are having a cough variant asthma , make sure you do not have difficulty breathing . there is something called cardiac asthma , but it s not much of a likelihood given your young age . i advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as smokers cough . it s time that you stop smoking , avoid animal dancers , mites , pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness , make sure you don't have a heart burn , and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge",

                "doctor_transcript": "thanks for your question on healthcare magic . i can understand your concern . swimming pool water is full of organisms . so possibility of relapse of pneumonia is more likely because your symptoms , coughing , wheezing , chest pain are more suggestive of pneumonia . so consult your doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray . if chest x ray is showing fresh infiltrates then you will need another course of antibiotics , mucolytic and expectorant drugs . avoid swimming for atleast 1 month . hope i have solved your query . i will be happy to help you further . wish you good health . thanks .",
